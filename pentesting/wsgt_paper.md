# Web Application Security Testing Evaluation (Argentina)

## Abstract

A model to help in evaluating security testing in web app based on :

* OWAST WSTG
* Logic Score of Preference LSP

----------

## Intro

* the demand for having a model that make possible the evaluation of the security methodology.
* We propose a model to assess how much a set of rules for the implem of security measures during web app development are observed.
* The model is based on WSTG whose tests are considered as the main features to be evaluated by the model implemented by the LSp Method
* "Systematic review of web application security development model"
* In The Open Source Security Testing Methodology (OSSTMM), Khairul Anwar
  Sedek et al. [15] adopt the Top Ten Critical Vulnerabilities defined by OWASP to
  create an additive model to evaluate the performance based on the OSSTMM.
* Organisation :
  * Section 2 gives a brief description of the OWASP WSTG, used for the construction of the proposed model. 
  * Section 3 describes the method adopted for the development of the security testing assessment model. 
  * Section 4 shows parts of a possible model 
  * Section 5 closes the work with some discussion and conclusions.

## WSTG :

* "You can’t control what you can’t measure."

## LSP Method :

* the first steps in LSP involve to make clear what the user requirements are. 

# A model for the Compliance Assessment of the WSTG Check list :

### The creation of the Requirement Tree.

* In first place, the relevant attributes for evaluating web application security testing
  were organized on a hierarchical structure, namely the Requirement Tree (RT).
  
* First level of the RT :

* Group I :
    1. Information Gathering (INFO)
    2. Configuration and Deploy Management Testing (CONF)
    
* Group II :
    3. Identity Management Testing (IDNT)
    4. Authentication Testing (ATHN)
    5. Authorization Testing (ATHZ)
    6. Session Management Testing (SESS)
    
* Group III :
    7. Input Validation Testing (INPV)
    
       1. WSTG-INPV-01
    
          .... 
    
       2. WSTG-INPV-18
    
    8. Testing for Error Handling (ERRH)
    
    9. Testing for Weak Cryptography (CRYP)
    
    10. Business Logic Testing (BUSL)
    
    11. Client Side Testing (CLNT)

Also it is important to mention that each of those sub items (WSTG-INPV-00...) is considered to have their own sub items, a set of related tests (and the tools to be employed in each case)

### Example of one of the elementary preferences (defined for one of the performance variables of the RT)

Elementary criterion %SQL: Percentage of passed test of SQL injection detection

**Type of metric**: Indirect
**Objective**: Determine the percentage of input fields free of SQL injections. The test-
er has to make a list of all input fields whose values could be used in crafting a SQL
query, including the hidden fields of POST requests and then test them separately,
trying to interfere with the query and to generate an error.
In any case, it is very important to test each field separately: only one variable must
vary while all the other remain constant, in order to precisely understand which pa-
rameters are vulnerable and which are not.

Related metrics:
1) #if : is the number of identified input fields, considering also HTTP headers
and cookies.

#SQLif : is the number of input field with detected SQL injections.
**Calculation method:**

#if > 0 => %SQL = 100 - #SQLif/#if *100

#if = 0 => %SQL = 100
